We're thrilled to announce Parachord, a new kind of music player that unifies all your music sources into one seamless experience.

## The Problem We're Solving

If you're like us, your music is scattered everywhere. You have playlists on Spotify, purchased albums on Bandcamp, rare live recordings on YouTube, and a carefully curated local library of FLAC files. Switching between apps to listen to a single playlist is exhausting.

Parachord changes that.

## How It Works

At its core, Parachord is a **metadata-first** music player. Instead of being locked to a single streaming service, Parachord understands what song, album, or playlist you want to play and finds the best available source based on your preferences.

Want to prioritize your local files? Done. Prefer Bandcamp when available to support artists directly? Easy. Fall back to YouTube for rare recordings that aren't on streaming services? Automatic.

## Key Features

- **Plugin Architecture**: Connect any music source through our extensible plugin system
- **Cross-Platform Libraries**: Sync favorites across services and keep everything in one place
- **Listen Along**: See what friends are playing and join their listening sessions in real-time
- **Own Your Playlists**: Export in standard XSPF format that works forever

## What's Next

We're currently in active development and will be opening up early access soon. If you want to be among the first to try Parachord, sign up for our mailing list.

The future of music listening isn't about choosing one service. It's about having them all work together.

Welcome to Parachord.

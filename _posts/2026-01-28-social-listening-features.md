Streaming services have made music more accessible than ever, but somehow listening has become more isolated. We're changing that with Parachord's social features.

## See What Friends Are Playing

The most requested feature during our early testing was the ability to see what friends are listening to. But here's the twist: it works across services.

Your friend uses Spotify while you prefer YouTube Music? No problem. Parachord shows you what they're playing regardless of the source, and you can listen to the same track from your preferred service.

## Listen Along

Take it a step further with Listen Along. When a friend is playing music, you can sync up with them in real-time. They control playback, and you hear the same music at the same moment.

It's like sharing headphones, but from anywhere in the world.

## Browse Friend Libraries

Ever wanted to explore a friend's music taste? With their permission, you can browse their Parachord library, see their playlists, and discover new music through people you trust instead of algorithms.

## Why This Matters

We believe the best music recommendations come from real humans. Algorithms are great at finding more of what you already like, but friends introduce you to things you never knew you needed.

> "The best music recommendation I ever got was from a friend who said 'you have to hear this.' We're building that into software."

## Privacy First

All social features are opt-in. You control exactly what's visible and to whom. Don't want to share your guilty pleasure playlist? Keep it private. Want to broadcast your impeccable taste? Go for it.

Social music should enhance your experience, not compromise your privacy.
